title: What is RSS?
---

A feed is also known as a “web feed” and the technical term (which you’ll see a lot) is “RSS feed.” A feed contains the latest content in a form that your newsreader app understands. (Your newsreader checks the feed automatically, every few hours.)

Tons of websites already have feeds, mostly news sites and blogs. You’ll often see a link at the bottom of the page that says “RSS” or an orange icon similar.

Whenever you see a website with a feed, that means you can subscribe to that site.

When you subscribe to only one site, you might say “This doesn’t save me much time.” But when you end up subscribing to 10 or 20, you’ll find that your newsreader becomes your regular place for news and to hear the latest.

You won’t miss content (unlike Facebook, there’s no algorithm deciding to drop content from your feed unless the author pays) and it’s spam-proof. Had enough? Just unsubscribe from the feed.
